A party game for 4 players to have fun!
You are to control your own cube while it turns and rushes forward... or falls miserably.

If two cubes collides, they will bounce according to their velocity. Try to push everyone down the cliff and earn the highest scores!

This game utilizes __AirConsole__ for 2 of the 4 players as controller. The ohter 2 player use keyboard.

## About AirConsole
This is a challenge from the GGJ 2019 to use it in the game.
The AirConsole is a platform where players can use their phones as controllers.

Find the game object _AirConsole_ in the scene, and set the option to __Normal__ makes it operate normally. A webpage containing unique game ID will show up. Players _connecting to the same Network_ can join the game with this ID.
__Virtual Controller__ opens a web page on PC the simulate phones.

## About Bugs
We wanted to add many features like player against bot (when players are not sufficient) or other alternatives to control the cubes. The two days were only enough to create this demo, so we surely feel eager to improve it.
