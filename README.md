A party game for 4 players to have fun!
You are to control your own cube while it turns and rushes forward... or falls miserably.

If two cubes collides, they will bounce according to their velocity. Try to push everyone down the cliff and earn the highest scores!

This game utilizes __AirConsole__ for 2 of the 4 players as controller. The ohter 2 player use keyboard.
